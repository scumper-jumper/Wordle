Wordle is a popular online word puzzle game where players try to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback:

- ✔️ Green tiles indicate letters that are correct and in the right position.
- 🟨 Yellow tiles show letters that are correct but in the wrong position.
- 💿 Gray tiles signify letters that are not in the word.

Players use these clues to refine their guesses and solve the puzzle. A new Wordle is available every day, making it a simple yet addictive challenge that encourages strategic thinking and vocabulary skills.
