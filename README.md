Wordle is a popular online word puzzle game where players try to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback:

Green tiles indicate letters that are correct and in the right position.
Yellow tiles show letters that are correct but in the wrong position.
Gray tiles signify letters that are not in the word.
Players use these clues to refine their guesses and solve the puzzle. A new Wordle is available every day, making it a simple yet addictive challenge that encourages strategic thinking and vocabulary skills.
